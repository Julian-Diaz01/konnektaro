## Test Coverage

### UserActivity Routes (`userActivityRoutes.test.ts`) - 32 tests
- ✅ POST `/user-activity` - Create user activity
  - Success case with all required fields
  - Validation for missing required fields
  - Duplicate submission prevention
  - HTML sanitization
- ✅ GET `/user-activity` - Get all user activities (admin)
- ✅ GET `/user-activity/user/:userId/activity/:activityId` - Get specific user activity
  - Found and not found scenarios
- ✅ PUT `/user-activity/user/:userId/activity/:activityId` - Update user activity
  - Success case
  - Missing notes validation
  - Not found scenario
  - HTML sanitization
- ✅ DELETE `/user-activity/user/:userId/activity/:activityId` - Delete user activity
  - Success case
  - Not found scenario
- ✅ **Integration Tests: Complete User Activity Journey**
  - Full lifecycle: create → get → update → get → verify
  - HTML sanitization throughout the journey
  - Validation errors and recovery scenarios

### Participant Routes (`participantRoutes.test.ts`) - 8 tests

  - Existing group activity update
  - No users found scenario
  - Single user handling
  - Database error handling
  - Review update error handling
  - Default share value handling

  - Socket error handling
  - Engine connection error handling
  - Error handling for uninitialized server
- ✅ **Activity Socket Events**
  - activityUpdate event emission
  - Multiple activityUpdate emissions
- ✅ **Group Activity Socket Events**
  - groupsCreated event emission
  - Multiple groupsCreated emissions
  - Error handling in emitGroupsCreated
  - Special characters in event/activity IDs
  - Very long event/activity IDs
- ✅ **Socket Integration Tests**
  - Concurrent socket emissions
  - Event data structure validation
  - Multiple connections from different sources to one socket
  - Multiple connections with different events
  - Connection and disconnection lifecycle

## Mock Strategy

All tests use comprehensive mocking to isolate the route logic:

1. **Authentication Middleware**: Mocked to always pass with test user data
2. **Database Collections**: Mocked with Jest functions to control return values
3. **External Services**: Mocked to prevent actual API calls
4. **Socket Events**: Mocked to prevent actual socket emissions
5. **HTML Sanitization**: Tested to ensure XSS prevention

## Test Utilities

The `testUtils.ts` file provides:
- Mock collection creators
- Mock request/response builders
- Sample test data
- Common assertion helpers

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't rely on other tests
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All endpoints, success cases, and error scenarios tested
3. **Realistic Data**: Tests use realistic sample data that matches the actual data structures
4. **Error Handling**: Tests verify proper error responses and status codes
5. **Security**: Tests verify HTML sanitization and input validation
6. **Edge Cases**: Tests handle edge cases like empty data, special characters, etc.

## Adding New Tests

When adding new routes or modifying existing ones:

1. Create test file in `src/__tests__/routes/`
2. Mock all dependencies using the established patterns
3. Test all HTTP methods and status codes
4. Include error scenarios and edge cases
5. Update this README with new test coverage information

## Test Results Summary

- **Total Tests**: 60 tests across all route and socket files
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (all tests passing)
- **Coverage**: 95-100% for tested routes and sockets
- **Execution Time**: ~12 seconds for full test suite
- **Integration Tests**: Complete user journey testing with data consistency verification
- **Socket Tests**: Comprehensive Socket.IO functionality testing including multiple connections
